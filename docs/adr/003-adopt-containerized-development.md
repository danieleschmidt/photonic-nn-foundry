# ADR 003: Adopt Containerized Development Environment

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The photonic-nn-foundry requires complex toolchains including:
- Verilog synthesis and simulation tools
- Python scientific computing stack
- Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools
- Process Design Kit (PDK) files and libraries
- Custom photonic simulation frameworks

Challenges:
- Complex dependency management across different tool vendors
- Licensing and availability of commercial EDA tools
- Reproducibility across different development environments
- Integration of open-source and proprietary tools

## Decision

We will adopt a containerized development environment using Docker as the primary deployment mechanism.

### Container Strategy

1. **Multi-stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime environments
2. **Tool Isolation**: Individual containers for different tool suites
3. **Volume Mounting**: Persistent storage for designs and results
4. **Development Containers**: Full development environment with IDE support

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reproducibility**: Consistent environment across all development machines
- **Dependency Management**: Isolation of complex tool dependencies
- **Portability**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows hosts
- **Scalability**: Easy deployment to cloud compute resources
- **Version Control**: Container images provide versioned environments
- **Collaboration**: Team members get identical development environments

### Negative

- **Performance Overhead**: Slight performance penalty compared to native execution
- **Disk Space**: Container images can be large with EDA tools
- **Complexity**: Additional layer of abstraction for debugging
- **Host Dependencies**: Still requires Docker runtime on host system
- **GPU Access**: Additional configuration needed for CUDA/OpenCL acceleration

### Technical Implementation

1. **Base Images**: Use official Python and Ubuntu LTS images
2. **Multi-stage Builds**: Minimize final image size
3. **Security**: Run containers with non-root users where possible
4. **Networking**: Expose necessary ports for Jupyter and web interfaces
5. **Volumes**: Persistent storage for user data and tool configurations

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build development environment
docker build -t photonic-foundry:dev .

# Launch interactive development
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace photonic-foundry:dev

# Run specific transpilation tasks
docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace photonic-foundry:dev \
    python transpile.py --model resnet18 --target photonic
```

### Integration Points

- **CI/CD**: Use same containers for testing and deployment
- **Documentation**: Jupyter notebooks running in container environment
- **Benchmarking**: Consistent environment for performance measurements
- **Distribution**: Users get complete environment without complex setup
