# ADR-0002: Docker-Based Development Environment

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The photonic-nn-foundry requires complex toolchains including:
- Verilog simulation tools (Icarus Verilog, Verilator)
- Photonic simulation frameworks (potentially MEEP, Lumerical APIs)
- Multiple Python dependencies with specific versions
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Traditional installation approaches face challenges:
- Complex dependency chains difficult to reproduce
- Platform-specific installation requirements
- Version conflicts between system and project dependencies
- Difficult onboarding for new contributors

## Decision
Use Docker as the primary development environment with:
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds
- Docker Compose for development services
- Devcontainer support for VS Code integration
- CI/CD pipeline integration for consistent builds

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reproducible development environment across all platforms
- Simplified onboarding for new contributors
- Consistent CI/CD environment matching local development
- Isolated dependencies preventing system conflicts
- Easy integration with cloud development platforms

### Negative
- Additional Docker knowledge required for contributors
- Potential performance overhead on some platforms
- Increased storage requirements for development images
- Network configuration complexity for some development scenarios

### Neutral
- Standard containerization practices for modern software development
- Aligns with industry best practices for complex toolchain management
