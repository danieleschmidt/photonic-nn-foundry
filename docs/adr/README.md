## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue motivating this decision?]

## Decision
[What is the change being proposed or has been decided?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]
```
