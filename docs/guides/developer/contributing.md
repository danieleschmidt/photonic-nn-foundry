- **Key Functions**: Model transpilation, batch profiling, report generation
- **Extension Points**: New commands, output formats

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Issue First Approach

Before starting significant work:
1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/photonic-nn-foundry/issues)
2. Create a new issue if none exists
3. Discuss approach with maintainers
4. Get assignment or approval to proceed

### 2. Development Process

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes with commits following conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(transpiler): add support for conv2d layers"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Code Quality Standards

#### Formatting and Linting
```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/

# Run all quality checks
make lint
```

#### Testing Requirements
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/photonic_foundry --cov-report=html

# Performance tests
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (done automatically in dev container)
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8, enforced by Black and Flake8
2. **Type Hints**: Required for all public APIs
3. **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all public functions
4. **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions with descriptive messages

Example:
```python
def torch2verilog(
    model: torch.nn.Module,
    target: str = 'photonic_mac',
    optimize: bool = False
) -> str:
    """Convert PyTorch model to photonic Verilog implementation.
    
    Args:
        model: PyTorch neural network model to convert
        target: Target photonic architecture ('photonic_mac', 'mzi_array')
        optimize: Whether to apply optimization passes
        
    Returns:
        Generated Verilog code as string
        
    Raises:
        UnsupportedOperationError: If model contains unsupported operations
        PDKCompatibilityError: If target incompatible with current PDK
    """
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
   - Location: `tests/unit/`
   - Coverage: > 90% for new code
   - Speed: < 1s per test

2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
   - Location: `tests/integration/`
   - Coverage: Key user workflows
   - Speed: < 30s per test

3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths
   - Location: `tests/performance/`
   - Coverage: Transpilation speed, memory usage
   - Speed: < 5min per test

#### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from photonic_foundry import torch2verilog
import torch.nn as nn

def test_linear_layer_transpilation():
    """Test transpilation of simple linear layer."""
    model = nn.Linear(10, 5)
    verilog = torch2verilog(model)
    
    assert 'module photonic_mac' in verilog
    assert 'input [9:0] data_in' in verilog
    assert 'output [4:0] data_out' in verilog

@pytest.mark.performance
def test_transpilation_speed():
    """Test transpilation performance for ResNet-18."""
    model = torchvision.models.resnet18()
    
    start_time = time.time()
    verilog = torch2verilog(model)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert duration < 10.0  # Should complete in < 10 seconds
```
