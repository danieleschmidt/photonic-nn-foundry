## Security Controls

### üîê Technical Controls

#### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Control Implementation:**
```yaml
# GitHub Repository Settings
Access Control:
  - Branch Protection: Required reviews, status checks
  - Repository Permissions: Least privilege principle
  - Secret Management: Encrypted at rest, audit logging
  - Two-Factor Authentication: Required for all contributors

# Container Security
Container Controls:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal base images (distroless)
  - Security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
  - Resource limitations
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Verify access controls
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection

# Check secret scanning
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/secret-scanning/alerts

# Validate container security
docker run --rm aquasec/trivy image photonic-foundry:latest
```

#### 2. Data Protection

**Control Implementation:**
```yaml
Data Classification:
  - Public: Documentation, open source code
  - Internal: Configuration templates, development data
  - Confidential: API keys, database credentials, certificates
  - Restricted: Production data, customer information

Encryption Standards:
  - At Rest: AES-256
  - In Transit: TLS 1.3
  - Key Management: Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
```

**Data Handling Matrix:**
| Data Type | Storage | Transmission | Access Control | Retention |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Source Code | GitHub (encrypted) | HTTPS/SSH | Branch protection | Indefinite |
| Secrets | GitHub Secrets | Encrypted API | Admin only | 90 days |
| Logs | Encrypted storage | TLS 1.3 | RBAC | 1 year |
| Metrics | Time series DB | TLS 1.3 | Read-only API | 2 years |

#### 3. Secure Development

**Control Implementation:**
```yaml
Secure Coding Practices:
  - Static Analysis: Bandit, Semgrep, CodeQL
  - Dependency Scanning: Safety, Snyk, Dependabot
  - Secret Detection: GitLeaks, TruffleHog
  - Code Review: Required approvals, automated checks

Development Environment:
  - Pre-commit hooks: Security linting, secret detection
  - IDE Security Plugins: Real-time vulnerability detection
  - Secure Defaults: Security-first configuration templates
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Administrative Controls

**Security Policy Template:**
```markdown
# Information Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements for the photonic-nn-foundry project.

## Scope

2. Dependencies must be kept up-to-date and vulnerability-free
3. Access must follow least privilege principle
4. All changes must be reviewed and approved
5. Security incidents must be reported within 1 hour

## Compliance
Violations may result in access revocation and project suspension.
```

#### 2. Training and Awareness

**Security Training Matrix:**
| Role | Required Training | Frequency | Verification |
|------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Developer | Secure Coding | Annual | Quiz + Practical |
| DevOps | Infrastructure Security | Annual | Certification |
