### 3.2 Quantum-Photonic Hamiltonian

We introduce a novel Hamiltonian that captures both quantum effects and photonic device physics:

```
H = H_photonic + H_quantum + H_interaction

H_photonic = Σᵢ ωᵢ a†ᵢaᵢ + Σᵢⱼ gᵢⱼ(a†ᵢaⱼ + aᵢa†ⱼ)

H_quantum = Σₖ Eₖ|ψₖ⟩⟨ψₖ| + Σₖₗ Vₖₗ|ψₖ⟩⟨ψₗ|

H_interaction = Σᵢₖ λᵢₖ a†ᵢaᵢ|ψₖ⟩⟨ψₖ|
```

Where:
- `ωᵢ` are photonic mode frequencies
- `gᵢⱼ` are coupling coefficients between photonic modes
- `Eₖ` are quantum state energies
- `Vₖₗ` represent quantum state interactions
- `λᵢₖ` couple photonic and quantum degrees of freedom

    coherent_state = initialize_coherent_state(
        amplitude=variational_params.amplitude,
        phase=variational_params.phase
    )
    
    # Coherent evolution through photonic circuit
    for layer in photonic_layers:
        coherent_state = apply_coherent_operation(
            coherent_state, layer, variational_params
        )
        
        # Maintain coherence through error correction
        coherent_state = quantum_error_correction(coherent_state)
