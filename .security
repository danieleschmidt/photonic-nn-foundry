# Enhanced Security Guidelines for Quantum-Photonic Neural Network Foundry

## Critical Security Requirements

### Code Execution Security
- ❌ NEVER use eval() or exec() with any input
- ❌ NEVER use os.system() for command execution
- ✅ Use subprocess.run() with proper argument validation
- ✅ Validate and sanitize all inputs before processing

### Secret Management
- ❌ NEVER hardcode passwords, secrets, or API keys
- ✅ Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ Implement proper secret rotation policies
- ✅ Use dedicated secret management systems in production

### Serialization Security
- ❌ NEVER use pickle.load() for untrusted data
- ✅ Use JSON for data serialization when possible
- ✅ Validate all deserialized data
- ✅ Implement cryptographic signatures for serialized data

### Quantum Security Framework
- ✅ Implement post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
- ✅ Use quantum-safe key distribution protocols
- ✅ Enable quantum random number generation
- ✅ Monitor for quantum decoherence attacks
- ✅ Implement quantum intrusion detection systems

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Require multi-factor authentication
- ✅ Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Use quantum-enhanced authentication protocols
- ✅ Log all access attempts and security events

### Network Security
- ✅ Use HTTPS/TLS 1.3+ for all communications
- ✅ Implement proper certificate validation
- ✅ Use quantum-safe cipher suites
- ✅ Enable perfect forward secrecy

### Data Protection
- ✅ Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256
- ✅ Encrypt all data in transit
- ✅ Implement proper key management
- ✅ Use quantum-enhanced encryption when available

### Monitoring & Incident Response
- ✅ Enable comprehensive security logging
- ✅ Implement real-time threat detection
- ✅ Use AI-powered anomaly detection
- ✅ Maintain incident response procedures

### Deployment Security
- ✅ Regular security updates and patches
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- ✅ Security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Production security monitoring
