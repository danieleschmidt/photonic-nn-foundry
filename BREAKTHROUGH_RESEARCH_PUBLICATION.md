## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Photonic Neural Networks

Silicon-photonic neural networks have emerged as a promising approach for AI acceleration [1-3]. Recent work by MIT demonstrated photonic DSP chips achieving sub-pJ/operation energy efficiency [4]. However, these implementations lack comprehensive error correction and suffer from phase instabilities.

### 2.2 Quantum Error Correction

Quantum error correction has been extensively studied for quantum computing applications [5-7]. Surface codes and stabilizer codes represent the state-of-the-art for quantum systems [8]. However, these approaches have not been adapted for photonic neural network applications.

### 2.3 Phase Optimization in Photonic Systems

Current phase optimization approaches rely primarily on classical gradient descent or genetic algorithms [9-11]. Recent work has explored machine learning approaches [12], but none have integrated quantum gradient estimation techniques.

**Research Gap**: No existing work combines quantum error correction with adaptive phase optimization specifically for photonic neural networks. Our algorithms address this critical gap.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Photonic Quantum Error Correction (PQEC)

Our PQEC algorithm implements quantum error correction specifically designed for photonic systems:

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Foundation

The PQEC Hamiltonian combines photonic dynamics with error correction:

```
H_PQEC = H_photonic + H_decoherence + H_correction
```

Where the correction term is:

```
H_correction = Σᵢ αᵢ |ψᵢ⟩⟨ψᵢ| ⊗ P_correction_i
```

#### 3.1.2 Error Syndrome Detection

Our adaptive syndrome detection uses machine learning models to identify error patterns:

1. **Bit-flip errors**: Detected via parity check violations
2. **Phase-flip errors**: Identified through phase correlation analysis  
3. **Amplitude damping**: Detected via photon number fluctuation monitoring
4. **Thermal decoherence**: Identified through coherence time analysis

#### 3.1.3 Real-time Correction

The algorithm performs real-time error correction during neural network inference using parallel syndrome detection and coherence-preserving updates.

### 3.2 Adaptive Quantum-Photonic Phase Optimization (AQPPO)

The AQPPO algorithm combines reinforcement learning with quantum gradient estimation:

#### 3.2.1 Mathematical Framework

The optimization objective includes classical, quantum, and coherence terms:

```
L_AQPPO = L_classical + λ₁L_quantum + λ₂L_coherence
```

Where:
```
L_coherence = -log(|⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t+dt)⟩|²) + γ·∇²ϕ(r,t)
```

#### 3.2.2 Quantum Parameter-Shift Gradients

We implement quantum parameter-shift rules for gradient estimation:

```
∂⟨H⟩/∂θᵢ = (⟨H⟩(θᵢ + π/4) - ⟨H⟩(θᵢ - π/4)) / (2 sin(π/4))
```

#### 3.2.3 Reinforcement Learning Policy

Our RL policy network learns optimal phase adjustments:

- **State representation**: Phase statistics, coherence metrics, energy values
- **Action space**: Phase adjustments bounded by [-π/4, π/4]  
- **Reward function**: Combines energy improvement, coherence preservation, and stability

#### 3.2.4 Coherence-Preserving Updates

Phase updates are constrained to preserve quantum coherence:

```
Δϕ_coherent = Δϕ_proposed × min(1, C_threshold / C_current)
```
